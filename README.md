Asper
=====

Asper is a lightweight, realtime collaborative source code editor based on <a href="#https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace">ace</a> and node.js. The Asper
server allows individuals to connect and write code together, from the comfort of their own HTML5 browsers: think Google Docs for code.
Multiple storage backends can be mounted by the Asper server and exposed to clients.
